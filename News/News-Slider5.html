						<li><strong>After CAF’s decision to strip the CAN hosting rights from Cameroon, several African countries will now submit their bid as a replacement host</strong></li>
					</ul>
					<p>The Confederation of African Football (CAF) might consider Morocco as an alternative host to Cameroon. The head coach of the national football team, Herve Renard, believes that Morocco is the right choice to host the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (CAN).</p>
					<p>Renard believes that Morocco is ready in terms of infrastructure to host the African tournament. The coach expressed his hope for Morocco to be designated as host country for CAN 2019 “even if it will add extra pressure.”</p>
					<p>Cameroon lost eligibility to host the competition after inspections  of the country’s sports venues revealed that it was not ready to host the tournament. CAF will now start a new bidding process to appoint another host for the CAN, which will take place from June 15 to July 17.</p>
					<p>While Morocco repeatedly supported Cameroon’s bid before CAF made its decision, the North African country might compete with South Africa and other countries to host it.</p>
					<p>Morocco’s successful experience in hosting the 2018 African Nations Championship (CHAN) might help Morocco clinch the rights to host CAF’s flagship tournament.</p>
					<p>Morocco’s Atlas Lions will take part in the CAF competition after a well deserved qualification.</p>
					<p>Fouzi Lekjaa, head of the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) said that although the national team has had several exceptional generations of teams, Morocco has not been able to win the CAN since 1976.</p>
					<p>He added that Morocco’s Atlas Lions and coach Herve Renard have received criticism. Lekjaa then called on critics to stop the “sterile criticism. We trust Herve Renard who has brought a lot to the Atlas Lions.” He also called for unity and support for both the coach and team.</p>
					<p>Morocco’s football team has delivered several solid performances, especially at the 2018 World Cup in their games against Portugal and Spain.</p>
					<p>In the 2019 CAN qualifiers, Morocco also received applause from their fans after they “broke the curse” and beat Cameroon 2-0.</p>
