						<li><strong>Malawi has just squandered its tiny qualifying chances by losing 2-1 to Comoros, sealing instead Morocco’s CAN 2019 qualification.</strong></li>
					</ul>
					<p>When Morocco impressively defeated Cameroon yesterday (2-0), catapulting Morocco’s Lions to Group B leadership with 10 points, qualification was merely mathematical.</p>
					<p>They still needed to wait for the next group B game between Malawi and Comoros.</p>
					<p>Despite the joy that came with defeating Cameron, there was in the air a lingering aura that suggested that the qualifying journey still had a next stop. The game against Malawi—assuming first that Malawi defeats Comoros— was still waiting, and it counted enormously for sealing the qualifying spot.</p>
					<p>So Morocco’s coach, who is famous for his take-nothing-for-granted attitude, seemed to be preaching self-constraint and respect for future opponents. Having coached Zambia in 2012, an underdog squad that shocked the entire African continent, Renard knows what can happen in 90 minutes of football.</p>
					<p>Meanwhile, Malawi needed two spectacular games—against Comoros today and against Morocco in April 2019—to change Group B dynamics, and perhaps even spoil Morocco’s ultimate joy: qualification. But Malawi’s loss has smashed the country’s hopes to qualify for CAN 2019.</p>
					<p>The defeat also ends any prospects of surprises in Group B, casting the dice for Morocco, who can now fully relish the joy of sealing qualification before the last game.</p>
					<p>Mission accomplished, then, as we prematurely reported yesterday. While qualification for Moroccan Lions was simply mathematical after their victory against Cameron, it is now official.</p>
					<p>And, as they now majestically sit on top of Group B with 10 points, having outclassed Cameroon (second with 8 points) in terms of head-to-head encounter, Morocco’s Lions can already start dreaming about being the continent’s champions.</p>
					<p>Bottom line: there will be no need to wait until the last game to engage in a thrilling anything-is-possible-in-football exercise.</p>
