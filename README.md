# CAN2019 Website Project using "PETAL Framework"

On November 30, 2018, the CAF decided to withdraw from Cameroon the organization of the phases
finals of the 2019 African Cup of Nations, due to the lack of preparation for
welcome the continental wedding. This decision paved the way for countries wishing to host
the tournament, the need to submit their records immediately.

Morocco, which has bet unsuccessfully for the 2026 FIFA World Cup â„¢, should
replace Cameroon as host. South Africa, host of the 2010 World Cup,
could also be considered.

The main objective of this project is the creation of a simple website to present and
promote this Moroccan candidacy which will probably compete with the offer of
South Africa.

The website should present the Moroccan dossier in a creative way to strengthen the
chances of this candidacy. You can inspire ideas to feed topics to
from other websites (for example: https://tokyo2020.jp/en/).

The technologies allowed in the project are: HTML5.2, CSS3 and JavaScript using,
mandatory, the Frameworks distributed by the draw of December 5, 2018.
The integration of some API (Application Programming Interface) is desirable.
